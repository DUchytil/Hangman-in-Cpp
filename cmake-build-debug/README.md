# Overview

This is a console-based Hangman game which allows one person to enter a word, and then allows the other person 7 attempts to guess each character in the word. When the game is finished, the player's stats will be displayed in the console.

I wrote this game as my first project in C++. I have some experience with C, so I decided it might be worth taking on the challenge of learning this popular and highly useful language. I've enjoyed making this project, and I've grown to enjoy programming in C++.

# Future Work

- Add an option to allow user to guess full word instead of only being able to guess a character at a time
- Add functionality to store player stats in a file to be read in. This would allow for users to view previous stats as well as keep track of a high score.
- Add graphical user interface
